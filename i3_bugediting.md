# Fix the Readme File

The `readme.md` file is a file that sits in the main directory of a repo. It's another way we use to communicate with each other. The `readme.md` file should include everything we need to get the repo running on our local computers. 

I've included the text we want in the readme below. Add the text, commit it to a new branch (**this is very important!**), then submit a pull request for the changes.

Once you've finished this lesson, I'll create a new `learning` issue and assign it to you, you'll need to go there to learn more.

---
If you need help, just @-mention me below asking for help and I'll send you a more detailed tutorial for how to do this. Again, keeping this issue open in its own tab while you do the work will make getting feedback and looking at the task list easier.


## Progress

- [ ] Edit readme file to include the information below.
- [ ] Commit the file to a new branch called "readme-bugfix".
- [ ] Create a pull request, include the text `fixes #3`.
- [ ] Once I comment with a :+1:, merge the PR.
- [ ] Delete the branch.



COMMENT 1

```
This is the content of the readme file.

* Right now this is just a blank repo.
* As we build more lessons, there will be more information in it.
* But every repo needs a readme file, so this is ours.
```

Sure thing `@user`! I wanted to push you because you'd learned the rest so quickly, but this trips everyone up the first time they try it. What you need to do is follow the instructions below.

8. Propose the file change. This will take you to a new PR screen.
9. In the comment section of the PR, include the text `fixes #3`. This tells the PR that it is associated with this issue.
10. Create the pull request.  
  ![Create PR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/create-pr.png)
11. Wait for the teacher to comment on your PR. 
12. Once they've given you the thumbs up, click "merge the pull request", and confirm the merge.  
  ![Merge PR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/merge-pr.png)
13. Delete the branch.  
  ![Delete Branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/delete-branch.png)
14. Come back to this issue by clicking on the "#3" in the comment from earlier. This issue should be closed, because of the `fixes` tag.
15. Confirm that the issue is closed and all the boxes are checked above, then go to the Issues View and look for the new `leanring`-labeled issue I've created and assigned to you. 

Once you do, I'll tell you a bit more about _why_ we do things this way. 



USER COMPLETES LESSON

Great job `@user`! That was a lot of help for us, and a lot to learn for you. Let's take a step back and learn more about what you just did. The steps you took are called **The GitHub Workflow**, and they are a very important part of how we do work on GitHub. 

In the next issue, we'll go through the workflow again, this time more slowly as we add a new feature to the app. When you're ready, go to the new issue I just created and assigned to you called **Add a Contact Us Page** and we'll get started there.
