# Fix the Readme File

The readme.md file is a file that sits in the main directory of a repo. It's another way we use to communicate with each other. The readme.md file should include everything we need to get the repo running on our local computers. 

I've included the text you need to add to the readme.md file in a comment below. Add that text to the file, then commit it. You'll find that we've locked the master branch, so you'll have to create a new branch to commit it to, which you can do right from the edit screen. We've included further instructions in a comment below, in case you run into trouble.

- [ ] Edit readme file w/ correct stuff.
- [ ] Commit the file to a new branch called "readme-bugfix".
- [ ] Create a pull request, include the text `fixes #3`.
- [ ] Once they comment w/ a :+1:, merge the PR.
- [ ] Delete the branch.

Once you've finished this lesson, I'll create a new `learning` issue and assign it to you, you'll need to go there to learn more.


COMMENT 1

```
This is the content of the readme file.

It should be markdown.

* Expose the students to markdown.
* They'll learn what it is later.
```
