# Managing Issues

Great job so far. You weren't lying about being a fast learner in your interviews, were you? ;-)

So now that you know your way around an issue, we're going to discuss how a repo works and learn some more advanced issue skills.

You've already gotten the first lesson down. You looked at the Issues view and were able to navigate to this issue.

Next, we're going to have you perform some batch actions on issues. I'll keep track of them here, and you'll be able to see your progress from within the Issues view, just look next to the title of this Issue.

## Progress

- [x] Look at Issue View
- [ ] From the Issue View, assign the green label `feature` to all the unlabeled issues.
- [ ] Assign the issue with both the red `bug` and gold `learning` label to yourself. 

---

If you get stuck on any of these tasks, the [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) GitHub Guide should have all the info you need to collect them. 

Once the status bar hits 100%, go ahead and close this Issue like you did the last one, and then click through to the bug Issue that you assigned to yourself.


USER ONLY ASSIGNS SOME ISSUES W/ FEATURE LABEL

Hey @peter.bell, looks like you didn't assign all the unlabeled issues like I asked. If you use the check boxes in the Issues View, you can assign multiple issues with the same label at the same time. I'd recommend doing it that way.


USER ASSIGNS THE WRONG LABEL

Hey @peter.bell, make sure you assign those issues with the `feature` label. I've removed the label you assigned, try it again.


USER ASSIGNS WRONG ISSUE

Hey @peter.bell, make sure to assign the issue with both the `bug` and `learning` labels to yourself.
