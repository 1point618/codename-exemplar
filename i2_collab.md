# Managing Issues

Great job so far. You weren't lying about being a fast learner in your interviews, were you? :wink:

Next, we're going to have you perform some batch actions on issues from the Issues View. I'll keep track of them here, and you'll be able to see your progress from within the Issues View, just refresh then look next to the title of this issue.

If you get stuck on any of these tasks, the [Mastering Issues GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) should have all the info you need to collect them. You can also come back here, and I'll give you feedback on what you've done so far. 

I recommend opening the Issue View in another tab while you work, so you can easily keep an eye on this issue.

Once the status bar hits 100%, go ahead and close this Issue like you did the last one, and then click through to the bug Issue that you assigned to yourself.

## Progress

- [x] Click on the Issues icon to go to the Issues View.
- [ ] From the Issues View, assign the green label `feature` to all the unlabeled issues.
- [ ] Assign "Fix the Readme File" to yourself. It's the issue with both the red `bug` and gold `learning` labels.

USER ONLY ASSIGNS SOME ISSUES W/ FEATURE LABEL

Hey `@user`, looks like you didn't assign all the unlabeled issues like I asked. If you use the check boxes in the Issues View, you can assign multiple issues with the same label at the same time. I'd recommend doing it that way.

USER ASSIGNS THE WRONG LABEL

Hey `@user`, make sure you assign those issues with the `feature` label. I've removed the label you assigned, try it again.


USER ASSIGNS WRONG ISSUE

Hey `@user`, make sure to assign the issue with both the `bug` and `learning` labels to yourself. It's called "Fix the Readme File".



USER FINISHES

Great job `@user`! Now close this issue and go to the Bug issue that you just assigned to yourself.
