Really fast. Did it mostly correctly.
- Didn't batch add labels b/c has been trained not to.

Felt there was too much to read. Wasn't context that helped, just more to read.

"Label all the unlabeled issues" maybe unclear that it's only the completely unlabeled issues. 

Liked the "open in tab suggestion". 

Saw links, but didn't click b/c he figured had read them already.
