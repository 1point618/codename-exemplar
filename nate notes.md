# Nate Spence notes

## lesson 1
1. chuckled to self when first update came through
2. didn't see second message right away.
3. got to lesson 2 OK, confused by stuff above it

## lesson 2
1. Wasn't sure what the issues view was.
2. Didn't see check box on the left to mass-assign issues
3. didn't realize "bug" was a label
4. would like to specify the names of the issues to label.
5. Once figured out the box and what to label, knew how to blabe. 
6. Again had a hard time getting back to the interaction w/ the bot like Jen did. 

## bugfix
1. Didn't see that could ask the bot for more help.
2. Chuckled at the bot's snark. Liked it.
3. Attempting the lesson.
4. Found repo name.
5. Edited repot. 
6. Commited to masster
7. Didn't read the whole list of instructions. used to having them on-hand while doing a task. 
8. Went back to the issue from the PR screen, so lost that PR. Cannot get back to that user flow using the instructions that we gave! 
9. Once got back to there did the rest easily.
10. Liked checking back to the check boxes. 


Only didn't open it in a new tab b/c i was on the other screen.

Knew issues were "conversaton threads".

Wanted images for what to click. Was confused about the github ui.

Would have probably explored a little on his own before the point of signing up to the course in a real-life situation.

Perfect format is a video. If we had thm would have gone straight to the videos. 

If it was a real bot, would have chatted with teh bot more. Tested out the system. 

Got tripped up batch-adding labels. Became uncertain as to whether was adding labels or filtering labels. Would have liked a little more explanation up front.

"That kind of content when I'm readin git or watching it I feel like 'yeah i get this already' but in truth that's only because they're explaining it well"
Feels that an experienced person is going to be forgiving of elemetnary explanations b/c they know who teh audience is. If anything it makes you feel good b/c there is stuff you know. 

Didn't see the links.

Wonders about the affect of being in converstaion. Feels less explorative thatn when doing it without someone watching over shoulder. 

At one point it hadn't quite clicked that he could got back tothe issues any time. Is used to a separation between a source of teaching materials and the workspace. Because of that got tripped up that he could go back to the lesson inside of the workspace. Once he got into a groove it wasn't a problem at all though. Worth addressing right off the bat! 

Interpreted "issues" as issues of a magazine.

Wanted to do more at the end. Took a while to click tho. 

Likes Khan academy. Challenges w/ payoff. Gamey. Videos. 

In this case it's even better because it's not just something abstract. 

Is more comfortable using issues to the point that he feels we could communmicate on a gh project together with them. 

Had never done a PR before, but knew what one was.
