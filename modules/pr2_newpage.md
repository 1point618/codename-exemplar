#Add a new contact page to the site.

Hey `@user`, thanks for making these changes.

I was testing them and I realized that some of the code was wrong—my fault, I gave you faulty code in the first place. It's a good thing we have multiple people look at it :relaxed:

To fix it, you'll need to change a line in the index.md file. I have commented on that line—go to the "files changed" tab up top and find that comment, then make those changes.


COMMENT In-Line on Last  Line of index.md:

This should be (/contact**.md**), not (/contact/).


USER FIXES FILE

:+1: looks like you fixed it `@user`. Let's merge, delete, then go back to the issue one last time.
