#Add a new contact page to the site.

Hey `@user`, thanks for making these changes.

I was testing them and I realized that some of the code was wrong—my fault, I gave you faulty code in the first place. It's a good thing we have multiple people look at it :relaxed:

To fix it, you'll need to change a line in the index.md file. I have commented on that line—go to the "files changed" tab up top and find that comment, then make those changes.


COMMENT In-Line:

This should be (/contact**.md**), not (/contact/).
