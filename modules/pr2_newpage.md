#Add a new contact page to the site.

Hey `@user`, thanks for making these changes.

I was testing them and I realized that some of the code was wrongâ€”my fault, I gave you faulty code in the first place. It's a good thing we have multiple people look at it :relaxed:

To fix it, you'll need to change a line in the index.md file. I have commented on that line. Go to the "files changed" tab up top and find that comment, then make those changes. You might want to edit the file in a new tab so you have easy access to the line comment. Then come back here to the "conversation" once you've fixed it.

You can always ask for help if you need it.


COMMENT In-Line on Last  Line of index.md:

This should be (/contact**.md**), not (/contact/).
