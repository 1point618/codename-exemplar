Let's create a "contact us" page so that our users can get in touch when they need to.

As always, you can check here to see whether you've completed the steps correctly by refreshing the page. If not I'll comment with how to fix it.

As usual, you can @-mention me and ask for help if you need it.

## Instructions

- [ ] Create a new branch called `contact-page`. All work must be done on this branch. The branch-creation button is on the main page of the repo.  
  ![Create Branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/create-branch-2.png)
- [ ] Create a new file in the directory called `contact.md`. The contents of that file are found in the first comment below. Commit that file to `contact-page`.
- [ ] In the `index.md` file, add a link to the contact page to the header. You'll find the code for doing this in the second comment below. Commit this change to `contact-page`.
- [ ] Create a PR which compares `master` to `contact-page`. Include the text `fixes 9` in the comment, and @-mention me in it.
- I will check your work and reply there with next steps. 


COMMENT 1:

Copy the text below into the `contact.md` file you create:

```

* [Contact Us](/contact/)
```


USER COMMENTS HELP before BRANCH is created

The branch button is found on the front page of the repo.

![Create Branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/create-branch.png)

Type the name of the new branch in the text box and hit "enter" to create the new branch and move to it.

A word of caution: make sure you're on that branch when you're editing. If you leave the repository then come back, it will default to showing you `master`, not your new feature branch.

USER COMMITS A FILE TO MASTER

Hey `@user`. You really oughtn't commit to `master`. I've cleaned up the commit, please try again, this time to the `contact-page` branch.

If you need help creating or finding that branch, the branch button is found on the front page of the repo.

![Create Branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/create-branch.png)

Type the name of the new branch in the text box and hit "enter" to create the new branch and move to it.

A word of caution: make sure you're on that branch when you're editing. If you leave the repository then come back, it will default to showing you `master`, not your new feature branch.

Great job completing the course. You now know everything you need to know to begin collaborating with others on GitHub. 

If you'd like to learn more, I'd recommend just getting started working with other people. Set up your own repo [here](https://github.com/new) and start inviting your friends. You can also collaborate with others on their repositories. Or, check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) to learn more about GitHub and what else you can do on it!

Do you have any feedback for me on how I could get better? @-mention my boss, `1point618`, below, and he'll be happy to chat with you.
