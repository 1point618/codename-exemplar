Let's create a "contat us" page so that our users can get in touch when they need to.

As always, you can check here to see whether you've completed the steps correctly, and if not I'll comment with how to fix it.

## Instructions

- [ ] Create a new branch called `contact-page`. All work must be done on this branch. The branch-creation button is on the main page of the repo.
- [ ] Create a new file in the directory called `contact.md`. The contents of that file are found in the first comment below. Commit that file to `contact-page`.
- [ ] In the `index.md` file, add a link to the contact page to the header. You'll find the code for doing this in the second comment below. Commit this change to `contact-page`.
- [ ] Create a PR which compares `master` to `contact-page`. Include the text `fixes 9` in the comment, and @-mention me in it.
- I will check your work and reply there with next steps. 


COMMENT 1:

Copy the text below into the `contact.md` file you create:

```
# Contact Us

* **Email**: hello@wheelhouse.io
* **Phone**: +1.404.555.1234
* **Twitter**: [@wheelhouse](https://twitter.com/wheelhouseio)

```


COMMENT 2:

Replace this text in `index.md`:

```
* [Our Products](/products/)
* [Our Mission](/mission/)
```

with this text:

```
* [Our Products](/products/)
* [Our Mission](/mission/)
* [Contact Us](/contact/)
```


USER COMMENTS HELP/BRANCH

The branch button is found on the front page of the repo.

![Edit Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/create-branch.png)

Type the name of the new branch in the text box and hit "enter" to create the new branch and move to it.

A word of caution: make sure you're on that branch when you're editing. If you leave the repository then come back, it will default to showing you `master`, not your new feature branch.
