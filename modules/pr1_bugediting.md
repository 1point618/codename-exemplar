USER COMPLETES TASKS CORRECTLY

:+1: Great job @johnpaulashenfelter, let's merge it then delete the branch!


USER FORGETS FIXES #3

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, looks great but next time remember to link to the issue the PR is based on by including the `fixes #` tag. I'll do it here:

fixes #3

Otherwise, :+1:, let's merge it then delete the branch!
