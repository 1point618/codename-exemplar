# Lesson 3: Fix the Readme File

The `readme.md` file is a file that sits in the main directory of a repo. It's another way we use to communicate with each other. The `readme.md` file should include everything we need to get the repo running on our local computers. 

I've included the text we want in the readme below. Add the text, commit it to a new branch called `readme-bugfix` (**this is very important!**), then submit a pull request for the changes.

Once you've finished this lesson, I'll create a new `learning` issue and assign it to you, you'll need to go there to learn more.

---
If you need help, just @-mention me below asking for help and I'll send you a more detailed tutorial for how to do this. Again, keeping this issue open in its own tab while you do the work will make getting feedback and looking at the task list easier.


## Progress

- [ ] Edit readme file, replacing the current text with the information below.
- [ ] Commit the file to a new branch called "readme-bugfix".
- [ ] Create a pull request, include the text `fixes #3`.
- [ ] Once I comment with a :+1:, merge the PR.
- [ ] Delete the branch.



COMMENT 1

```
This is the content of the readme file.

* Right now this is just a blank repo.
* As we build more lessons, there will be more information in it.
* But every repo needs a readme file, so this is ours.
```

USER COMPLETES LESSON

Great job @sabinamehmedovic! That was a lot of help for us, and a lot to learn for you. Let's take a step back and learn more about what you just did. The steps you took are called **The GitHub Workflow**, and they are a very important part of how we do work on GitHub. 

In the next issue, we'll go through the workflow again, this time more slowly as we add a new feature to the app. When you're ready, go to the new issue I just created and assigned to you called **Add a Contact Us Page** and we'll get started there.
