# Managing Issues

Great job so far. You weren't lying about being a fast learner in your interviews, were you? :wink:

Now we're going to have you perform some batch actions on issues from the Issues View. If you get stuck on any of these tasks, the [Mastering Issues GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) should have all the info you need to complete them. 

You can also come back here, and I'll give you feedback on what you've done so far. 

I recommend opening the Issue View in another tab while you work, so you can easily keep an eye on this issue.

Once I've indicated that you've completed all the steps, go ahead and close this issue like you did the last one. Then click through to the `bug` issue that you assigned to yourself.

## Instructions
**Remember, you must refresh the page to see whether I've checked off a step.**

- [x] Click on the Issues icon to go to the Issues View.
- [ ] From the Issues View, label all the _unlabeled_ issues with the green `feature` label.
- [ ] Assign **Fix the Readme File** to yourself. It's the issue with both the red `bug` and gold `learning` labels.

USER ONLY ASSIGNS SOME ISSUES W/ FEATURE LABEL

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, looks like you didn't assign all the unlabeled issues like I asked. If you use the check boxes in the Issues View, you can assign multiple issues with the same label at the same time. I'd recommend doing it that way.

USER ASSIGNS THE WRONG LABEL

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, make sure you assign those issues with the `feature` label. I've removed the label you assigned, try it again.


USER ASSIGNS WRONG ISSUE

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, make sure to assign yourself to the issue with both the `bug` and `learning` labels. It's called **Fix the Readme File**. I've un-assigned you from the other issue.


USER FINISHES

Great job @johnpaulashenfelter! We use these batch actions to work with multiple issues at a time. Once all your issues are labeled and assigned, it makes it easy to seach for all the issues which are tracking a bug, or all the issues which you have assigned to yourself. 

Now close this issue and go to the `bug` issue that you just assigned to yourself, **Fix the Readme File**. We're going to take a look at how to move beyond communicating on GitHub to actually collaborating on the code.
