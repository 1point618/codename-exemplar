#Using Issues to Communicate

Hi `@user`! Welcome to the team.

I'm Adrian, your new manager. Today I'll be onboarding you to GitHub. GitHub is where we manage our projects and store our code and content. You'll be up and running in no time.

This is an "Issue", which we use to communicate about the projects. Issues are kind of like email threads, but they lives inside GitHub. We'll be using Issues to help you learn how to use GitHub!

To get started, type a comment below. @-mention me by typing the `@` symbol followed by my user name so I get pinged when you do.


USER COMMENTS

Great job! @-mentions are used to tag people into conversations so that they know you're talking about them and want their input. A person will receive a notification when you @-mention them.

Now, on the right, assign this issue to yourself and label it with the gold `learning` label. I'll keep track of your progress in this comment. If you're not sure if you did it right, refresh the page then check below to see if I checked the box or not.

- [ ] Assign self.
- [ ] Add `learning` label.

If you can't figure out, @-mention me in a comment asking for "help" and I'll give you more direct instructions.



USER COMMENTS HELP

You can perform these actions to the right. 

1. Click the link that says "assign yourself".
2. Click the gear next to "label" and select learning from the drop-down box.

USER PERFORMS BOTH ACTIONS

Great job `@user`!

We use issues for all sorts of communications, including reporting bugs, requesting new features, open-ended discussions about our project, and tracking the development of the project. 

An issue can be assigned to someone so that they know that they "own" the issue and the work that it will take to complete it. 

We label issues so that we can more easily search through them. 

You can also use [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) to format issuesâ€”that's how I made those sweet check boxes and that link. 

There's one more thing to learn about Issues, then we can move on. Close this issue below, then click on the Issues icon\*  to the right to get to the "Issues View", then click through to the issue named **Lesson 2: Managing Issues**.
