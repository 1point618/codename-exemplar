#Using Issues to Communicate

Hi @johnpaulashenfelter! Welcome to the team.

I'm Adrian, your mentor. Today I'll be onboarding you to GitHub. GitHub is where we manage our projects and store our code and content. You'll be up and running in no time.

This is an "Issue", which we use to communicate about the projects. Issues are kind of like email threads, but they live inside GitHub. We'll be using Issues to help you learn how to use GitHub!

To get started, type a comment below. @-mention me by typing the `@` symbol followed by my user name so I get pinged when you do. No need to write anything else.


USER COMMENTS W correct @-mention

Great job! @-mentions are used to tag people into conversations so that they know you're talking about them and want their input. A person will receive a notification when you @-mention them.

Now, on the right, assign this issue to yourself and label it with the gold `learning` label. I'll keep track of your progress in this comment. If you're not sure if you did it right, **refresh the page** then check below to see if I checked the box or not.

- [ ] Assign self.
- [ ] Add `learning` label.

If you can't figure out, @-mention me in a comment asking for "help" and I'll give you more direct instructions.


USER COMMENTS WITHOUT correct @-mention

Oops. Next time, include my user name after an `@` symbol, like this:
`@1point618`.

@-mentions are used to tag people into conversations so that they know you're talking about them and want their input. A person will receive a notification when you @-mention them.

Now, on the right sidebar, assign this issue to yourself and label it with the gold `learning` label. I'll keep track of your progress in this comment. If you're not sure if you did it right, refresh the page then check below to see if I checked the box or not.

- [ ] Assign self.
- [ ] Add `learning` label.

If you can't figure out how to do this, @-mention me in a comment asking for "help" and I'll give you more direct instructions.


USER COMMENTS HELP

You can perform these actions on the Issues sidebar to the right. 

![Label and Assigning Tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/label-assign.png)

1. Click the link that says "assign yourself".
2. Click the gear next to "label" and select `learning` from the drop-down box. 


USER ASSIGNS WRONG LABEL

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, you should actually have labeled this issue as `learning`, not `XXX`. It's no big deal, go ahead and change it above and we'll move forward.


USER ASSIGNS WRONG PERSON

Hey @johnpaulashenfelter, you should have assigned yourself to the issue, not `@XXX`. You can fix this by clicking on the gear next to the **Assignee** label and selecting yourself, then we'll move on.


USER PERFORMS BOTH ACTIONS

Great job @johnpaulashenfelter!

We use issues for all sorts of communications, including reporting bugs, requesting new features, open-ended discussions about our project, and tracking the development of the project. 

An issue can be assigned to someone so that they know that they "own" the issue and the work that it will take to complete it. 

We label issues so that we can more easily search through them. 

You can also use [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) to format issuesâ€”that's how I made those sweet check boxes and that link. 

There's one more thing to learn about Issues, then we can move on. In order to keep things clean, we close Issues once we're finished with them. Close this issue below, then click on the Issues icon \(![Issue Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1point618/codename-exemplar/master/img/issue-icon.png)\) to the far right to get to the "Issues View", then click through to the issue named **Lesson 2: Managing Issues**.
