* Be explicit. 
* Users are going to get things wrong in surprising ways.
* More advanced users like that they don't have to read everything, can ask for help when they need it.
* Users can feel bad having to ask for help.
* Users assume that when the text is not helpful, asking for help will just result in more text, not in more helpful instructions.
* Copy matters: "progress" checks will not be read until after they are completed, whereas "instruction" checks will be read before completing tasks.
* When presented with outside links in the text, different users behave in different ways. I do not yet have a good method for classifying types of users or why they act in these ways.
    - Some users will not even notice them.
    - Some users will notice them, and ignore it.
    - Some users will open in the background to save for later.
    - Some users will open the article right away and skim through it.
* Users have to be taught to treat an issue in the same way that they would treat an article: opening it in a tab and moving back and forth between the "learning" tab and the "activity" tab.
* Everyone so far has said they'd prefer learning with the information in an issue as opposed to information in an article.
* There are cultural hurdles to overcome.
    - Mistakes are OK.
    - Post-scarcity economy (comments, branches, files, etc, are cheap).
    - Public code and activity are OK.
* Non-technical users do not like the GH interface and find it confusing. 
    - In particular, the term **Issue** trips people up because of the negative connotations that the word carries.
    - Personally, I hate that you can't embed octicons in comments/markdown in the same way you can embed emoji.
* Bots and story should be used to add context to _why_ the user is doing something, but should not add superfluous text.
* "You have about three sentences before I just want to start doing things."
* Users will not read anything below the check boxes, so those must go at the end of a comment. 
* Users will look closely at an image where they might not read text closely.
