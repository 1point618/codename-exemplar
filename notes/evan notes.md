Webhook: #5

* issue 2 should have "then see what i posted below" instead of 'then go to issue 3'
* did very well on the issues
* didn't include the "fixes #3" in the pr, my comment wasn't clear on how he should have done it.
* typos in bugfix final message
* figured out where to create a branch
* user flow to see the line comment is somewhat off. 
    - can't see comment at first, has to go to to the "split view"
    - no comment visible once editing
    - dont' tell him where to go once editing is done


* "not bad"
* What's nice is that you're right inside github
* Has never used GH this way before, so felt that he had learned a lot
* has used cloud9 before, not issues or prs
* really likes the idea for working on programminmg langauges /projects
*
