1. Knows and uses github.
2. Opened Mastering Issues guide in the background. Didn't go to it.
3. Did everything fast and mostly correctly.
4. Had never done any of those things. Mostly just used github to host code for multiple of his own machines. 
5. Definitely learned how to do new things. Wants to begin experimenting with issues w/ his projects. 
6. Liked the "ask for help" part, didn't ask for help himself. 
7. Coming into it cold, would have wondered "why" did the branch/merge workflow. 
8. "A lot of people aren't used to the post-scarcity mindset". People aren't comfortable to just create as many comments/branches/prs as they need because it feels wasteful. 
9. The personality of the bots didn't distract, didn't love it either. 
10. Was diaspointed that it ended where it did, would want to recommend it to other people. 
11. Cultural shiftsâ€”some people have a hard time coming form non-OSS to the OSS way of doing things. IBM user group. 
12. Merged before I'd commented w/ the +1.
13. Didn't use the "fixes" keyword.
14. I think we can let people go through the flow even if they don't do those things, and remind them to do it in the next lesson.
