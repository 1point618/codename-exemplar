#Notes

##Lesson 1
1. "issues" is a really confusing name. has a negative connotation. The phrase "this is an issue" especially.
2. Confused about "assing to self" and "label". Was looking for "an issue" that she could assign to herself. Confusion over what an issue is.
3. Need to update copy to refresh page for check boxes.
4. Didn't know to scroll down to see the new message i sent.
5. Had a hard time finding "issues" tab. 

##Lesson 2
1. Didn't expect the robot to be cheeky. "Good bad or neutral surprise?" "It was OK."
2. Confused about what issues view is, how to get to it.

It's tough but she's definitely learning the interface. Figured out how to batch add Issues and Assignees on her own. Now knows what the issue view is and how to get there.

Hampered by connectivity issues.

At one point forgot what she was supposed to do, but her first response was to try to remember it, not to go back to the issues that contained the instructions.

##Lesson 3
1. Didn't read anything below check boxes. 
2. Didn't like the bot saying you'd learned the rest quickly, but not this one. Felt chastized, annoyed b/c we didn't include enough info for her.
3. Lots of steps.
4. Felt frustrated enough to give up. Too many steps, would have to scroll up and down to look at directions. Unclear that this work is done outside of the issue. 

##Final questions
Images / screenshots would have been SUPER userful. 

Wasn't sure how to feel about the bot having a personality. The second comment annoyed her a lot.

Didn't click on either link. Didn't notice them.

Still doesn't understand what an issue is. Just trying to follow the instructions. 

"The only thing I was trying to do was follow the directions, but I'm a little fuzzy on what I actually did or how it would fit into a bigger picture."

If the content were better, would that have helped? "Yeah, maybe?"

When asked whether she'd prefer doing this on github, or getting sent an article about github, she seemed to mildly prefer this, but without seeing better content was hard to tell. From watching her, she definitely learned more this way even if she didn't feel like it.
