Webhook #4

* Plowed through lesson 1. No issues.
* Opened issue view in new tab.
* Blew through lesson 2. Only issue was didn't refresh to see the check boxes.
* Finished very quickly, no problems.

* Wasn't really fun.
* Didn't have a good grasp of what the big picture was. 

* Didn't mind the instructions. But would like to know what merge and pull mean. 
* Reminded her of editing wikipedia, which is another form of version control

* Running her through the new stuff. She's taking the time to read the wall of text, the github flow github guide, etc.
* Really likes the new content. 
* Would have liked maybe an explanation of some of the terms. Pull request, merge, etc. 

* Figured out how to create a new branch
* Figured out how to add a file. Took a while.

* When fixing the file from the PR, had a hard time finding where to edit it. Once she did, she forgot what to edit it, b/c the line comment doesn't show up in the edit view. These are things we'll have to point out in the "please edit this" comment.
* The change should be something more obvious, or we should be more explicit in the instructions. 


* "Once I knew what a PR and merge and everything were, I felt like I was accomplishing a goal instead of just following along."

* Definitely learned stuff. Had never used github before. 

Questions she still has:

* Social norms around how much you change before you do a PR.
* Feels that she knows enough about GH to use it, hesitations are more about social aspects than tools. 
* Didn't mind that the bot had personality
    - The references to manager/interview felt forced. 
    - More of a "i'm the bot that is going to help you" would be good.
*
