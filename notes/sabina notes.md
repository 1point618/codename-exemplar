1. doesn't like the word "issue" either
2. why would i even want to use github?
3. where do you recieve notification
4. tried to start a new issue, not assign this issue. may have been because we had to stop.
5. had internet issues which meant the issues didn't load right away
6. intenret bad meant that comments didn't auto-update
7. took time but figured how to used the issue view
8. i forgot to label things!
9. i use "repo" without lettinmg people know it means "repository".
10. hover text would be useful!
11. clicked around to find the readme, did it eventually
12. but then got lost, had to find way back to the issue. opened issue 2 in a tab, but not issue 3
13. created the branch first
14. README.md, not readme.md
15. created a PR _before_ editing the file
16. Assumes that since the existing text isn't helping, then more text isn't going to make it more clear
17. Make it more clear what asking for help does. "Just try to play around, it's ok to get stuck".
18. Liked the idea of "here's a task, figure it out", but coming into it not knowing what the different terms are made the learning more frustrating.
19. Didn't like having two tabs, going back and forth. 
20. Divide into smaller steps. Having a list of 5 things is too much in working memory. 
21. Progress is associated with passively watching a bar fill up. "tasks" is better
22. Brain remembered "branching" so played around with that first rather than editing the file first. 
23. Don't remember things step by step, remember the general concepts.
24. Definitely feels like she learned things
25. Wasn't a fun process
26. Not quite sure what or why she's doing what she is. MORE STORY
27. Wants fictional people, bots. Loves the idea of having story. 
28. "give me a sense that this is a tool _for_ something, it's not just random buttons and random things to click"
29. "a little bit fun" learning something new. "here's a quest"
30. after every little section, ask/tell people what they learned
31.
