Webhook #3

* Fairly confident using git for his own stuff. Mostly solo. 
* All he knows about GH is cloning stuff and using it for personal stuff. 
* Wasn't sure what to type on the first comment, not the only person with that issue. Be more explicit
* Had a hard time w/ the labels because he didn't see anything that said learning. Once he saw "labels" he got it quickly. Asked me for help, not the bot.
* Took a while to find the issues label but the image really helped.
* Copy/pastes instructions into a text editor. 
* Opened in new tab as suggested.
* Opened Mastering Issues in a new tab.
* Got through the whole workflow no problem.
* "When I read a good tech tutorial, I like to think I'm reading 'legit shit', and legit shit isn't going to use exclamation points and baby language." Didn't like the bot's personality. 
    - Gives him the sense that what he's reading isn't the autoritative source.
    - Less so when it's "great job", signaling he's done it. 
    - Authoratative, Cold, Consice, Terse: these are good words signaling a good bot. 
* More chunked: He wanted comments to be more linear. 
    - Stack overflow is so awesome because it forces you to ask about just one thing and the answer will be so specific. 
* Saw the help button, needed help, thought that he didn't need help until I pointed it out to him. 
* Would not do more of this, would rather go to a book and download and read the PDF.
* Isn't sure if he'd tell others to use this. 
* Likes to look at tables of contents. Doesn't have that with this app, so had an unconscious "friction" because he didn't know how long it would take or where it was going.
