1. wasnt' signed in when started.
2. saw that he needed to refresh the page
3. likes the learning tags
4. opened "mastering issues" in another tab. went over there to read it. skimmed it, saved it for later.
5. labeled too many issues with the 'feature' tag, must add that
6. the color of 'feature' is wrong
7. saw to open things in tabs, is doing that
8. inclination was to copy/paste readme text but wasn't srue if there was another way to add a comment to a file
9. now he is confused, don't know whre he is in relation to the repo proper
10. didn't commit to a new branchâ€”because the default is to commit to master, he had forgotten the steps by the time he got there
11. saw the "ask for help" comment, but wasn't confused enough to do it... even though he was
12. would only ask for help after having tried to solve the question first: HELP only works for Known Unknowns, not Unknown Unknowns.
13. didn't read the progress piece before going to do the stuff
14. would prefer the instructions say "this is very important" before the sentence , not as a parenthetical
15. by the time he's read the first 3 sentences, wants to get to it
16. likes checking off boxes
17. felt like he's actually learned about issues, very glad he knows about it
18. thinks this is better than hosting it on another website, likes for a tutorial to be as close to the real thing as possible
19. wants to complete the tutorial on his own
20. feels like he hasn't learned about branching, just to branch. wants to either learn about it first, be told he'd learn about it later, or be given a link to learn about it on his own time. could do this through story, copy, etc., just wants to know that he will learn about it at some point so he doesn't have to teach himself
21. enjoyed it because he felt that he was learning things that he wanted to learn. inherent enjoyment, not external caused by bots or story or whatever
22. for matt there is a point there there is an "overabundancee of narrative" that takes away from learning
23. liked the bot saying the interview thing
24. there isn't a lot of obvious visual hierarchy going on
25. preference is for issues to look as much like real issues as possible while still being good to learn from
