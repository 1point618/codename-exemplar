Webhook 7

* Figured out the at-mentions
* Figured out the labels but i hadn't sent them up doh
* Liked the "great job!"
* Went to delete my comment when trying to close the issue
* Wasn't sure where to go after closing issue and going to issues viwe. figured it out by going back.
* **Labeled too many things with "feature"** need to come up with text for that.
* Having some trouble managing tabs, but figures it out.
* Asked for help on the readme-bugfix thing. Once she did, she just went back and forth to the images, no longer trying to figure it out on her own. We should chunk that help so that the user doesn't do the _whole_ thing with help, only the part they need.
* Didn't understand to click around on the graphic on the github workflow. 
    - Once she did, felt disinclined to read them because she didn't understand what it said. Too much jargon.
* Wasn't sure how to branch, so hit the "fork" button. 
    - Then read the directions more fully.
    - Then went to the front page and hit the "branch: 1" button. Can't create a branch from there!
    - Got to the new branch dialog, but "there is not create button" so didn't know what to do.
* Found out how to create a new file.
* Is copying/pasting the branch name into the commit message.
* Had a really hard time with the PR in the final one, it's not clear where and how to click.
    - The line comment takes a while to appear. I need to test this more.
    - The line comment disappears once you hit edit.
    - Didn't know to go back to the Issue once merge/delete.
    - Didn't know _how_ to get back to the Issue either.
    - 

* Didn't enjoy it b/c "Doing things I don't know how to do makes me feel stupid and I don't like that".
* "I laughed at the bot for how proud it was of me for finishing such basic tasks". 
* The interface for PRs is a lot more complicated than for issues.
    - Felt like she "lost the reference" when moving around sometimes
* Liked the bot was friendly "as someone who wants someone to hold my hand".
    - The further into it she is the less nice she needs the bot to me.
* Would definitely take this course if it were about collaborate on academic papers. 
    - "I would ask my university to pay for it."
* "I felt like that's the point of the bot, when I don't know what to do it will tell me what to do. It's way more frustrating to click around than to ask for help."
* Primed to ask for help at the beginning when did it the first time. Loved the tutorials so wanted to ask for help more. 
* If I'd been silent on the last project would have asked for help. 
* Just naturally asked for help in plain human language.
