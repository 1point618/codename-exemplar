#Using Issues to Communicate

Hi @peter.bell!

Welcome to the team. I'm your manager, Brienne, and I'll be onboarding you to GitHub. GitHub is where we manage our projects and store our code. You'll be up and running on it in no time.

This is an Issue. Issues are one of the main ways we collaborate on code in GitHub. We use them to file bug reports, request new features, and track the progress of the project. You can assign Issues to people, as well as give them labels and then search by those labels. You can also use markdown to format the text and images in the Issues.

To get a sense of how Issues work, let's do some work inside of this issue. First, comment below, mentioning me by including my user name after the @ symbol below. 


USER COMMENTS

Great job! @-mentions are used to tag people into conversations so that they know you're talking about them and want their input. A person will get a notification when you @-mention them.

Now, on the left, assign this issue to yourself and label it with the `learning` label. I'll keep track of your progress in this comment.

- [ ] Assign self.
- [ ] Add `learning` label.  


USER PERFORMS BOTH ACTIONS -- CHECK BOXES UPDATED

Great job @peter.bell! 

Now that you know how to use Issues, let's close this one and move onto the next lesson. Click on the "Issues" tab to the right, click on the check box for this Issue, then "mark as" closed. Once you've done that, go to the other isssue that has the gold `learning` label and we'll continue from there.





Hi @peter.bell! Welcome to the team.

I'm Brienne, your new manager. Today I'll be onboarding you to GitHub. GitHub is where we manage our projects and store our code and content. You'll be up and running in no time.

This is an issue, which we use to communicate about the project on GitHub. To get started, type a comment below. @-mention me by typing the `@` symbol followed by my user name so I get pinged when you do.

Great job @peter.bell!

We use issues for all sorts of communications, including reporting bugs, requestiong new features, open-ended discussions about our site, and tracking the development of the site. An issue can be assigned to someone so that they know that they "own" the issue and the work that it will take to complete it. We label issues so that we can more easily search through them. You can also use markdown to format issuesâ€”that's how I made those sweet check boxes. 

There's one more thing to learn about Issues, then we can move on. Close this issue below, then click on the "Issues" icon to the right, then go to the other issues labeled `learning`.
